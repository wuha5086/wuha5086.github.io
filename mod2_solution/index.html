                <p>When you get addicted to looking for opportunities,
                        you will become lazy. You will become both physically
                        and mentally lazy. Physically you will not want to
                        “hustle” and work hard. Mentally, you will not be able
                        to think analytically and you will not want to stress
                        your brain with things like marketing, customer
                        support etc that business owners bother themselves
                        with. I decide on what to sell only AFTER I have seen a
                        market that wants to buy. Rather than create a
                        product and look for customers, I discover customers
                        (market) and then create a product or service for that
                        market. I am not in love with any kind of business or
                        service. I am in love with the market. I will sell
                        anything (legal) that will satisfy that market.</p>
